## Problem Statement
What we aim to do is create an efficient classification model that best predicts if a given patient is likely to develop cardio vascular disease or not.

## Overview of our approach towards the problem

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights on the Data
  a. Data Cleaning
  b. Data Summarization: Describe the data and its distributions
  c. Data Visualization: Create graphical summaries of the data
  
2. Transform the data for training the different classification algorithms

4. Apply the different Machine Learning Algorithms
  a. Train, Cross validate, perform appropriate hyperparameter tuning
  b. Comparative analysis of the accuracy of the models
  
4. Gain insights from the results obtained
